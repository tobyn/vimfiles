# Vim Configuration

This is my Vim setup. I have been using Vim for many years, but nowadays
I mostly use Vim as a fallback for editing simple files that don't have
a more powerful IDE with Vim emulation.

As a result, at this point everything here works the way I like it, and
changes to this repo are 90% due to me getting a new computer. If you're
looking for an active template repo to copy, this is probably not state
of the art.
